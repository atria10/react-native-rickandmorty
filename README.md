# React Native Rick and Morty

The project was developed in order to learn how React Native works.


## API Reference
For this project I used the [Rick and Morty Api]( https://rickandmortyapi.com/)



## Documentation
I developed the project using redux/toolkit.
I handled the api query by using [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)].

For the screen navigation I used [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
